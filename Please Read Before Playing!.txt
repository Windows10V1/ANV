Are you looking for an original OC mod with banger tracks and cool visuals?
Then look no further...
Welcome to Aaron's Night Vibin'!

Let me list of some info you may need before playing:

Comic Aaron - Aaron is a goofy little shadow creature from another planet. He loves to make everyone laugh and is all around a happy spirit!

Anthony - Anthony is the villain and arch nemesis to Comic Aaron. He's well known for his machines and gadgets that he's created over the years.

Halo - Halo, also known as [REDACTED], is also a very chill person to be around! He's also a happy spirit just like Aaron and loves chill and calm music!

Bread - Bread is Aaron's cousin and prefers to be called Bread. Do NOT call him anything else OTHER than Bread. Bread loves to play his favorite game, Minecraft, and is also a swordsman!

Rose - Rose is also Aaron's cousin and Bread's sister. She loves the outdoors, nature is like her calming place! She loves gardening, and bows, trust me when I say this but she's a whole different person with a bow and arrow...

Windows10V - Windows, also known as [REDACTED], is a Brazilian guy who likes to chill at his house. One day, he receives a YouTube notification on his phone from Aaron, asking him if he could make him a chromatic. Ever since he's agreed to the comment, Windows was never seen again.




I will get revenge.
